						<p>Hi there! My name is Kelly, and I'm a 2nd-generation Taiwanese-American currently residing in the wonderful city of Austin, Texas. In 2016, I decided to take the leap of faith to leave the pre-health professions path that I was on, in order to pursue my interests in art, music, design, & digital content creation.</p>

						<p>While I may be relatively new to the field of design, my passion for technology & all things creative began since I was a teenager, and has only continued growing from there, serving as a guiding undercurrent shaping most of my life experiences, both personally & professionally. Fascinated by the intersection between science & the arts, I hope that my experiences as a researcher, clinician, educator, & artist can help empower, enrich, and inspire others through data & empathy-driven work. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
